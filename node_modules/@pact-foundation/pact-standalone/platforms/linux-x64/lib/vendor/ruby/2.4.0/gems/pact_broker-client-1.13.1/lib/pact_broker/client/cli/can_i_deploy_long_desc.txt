Returns exit code 0 or 1, indicating whether or not the specified pacticipant versions are compatible. Prints out the relevant pact/verification details.

The environment variables PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL_BASE_URL, PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL_USERNAME and PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL_PASSWORD may be used instead of their respective command line options.

SCENARIOS

Check the status of the pacts for a pacticipant version. Note that this only checks that the most recent verification for each pact is successful. It doesn't provide any assurance that the pact has been verified by the *production* version of the provider, however, it is sufficient if you are doing true continuous deployment.

  $ pact-broker can-i-deploy --pacticipant PACTICIPANT --version VERSION --broker-base-url BROKER_BASE_URL

If all applications within the pact network are not being deployed continuously (ie. if there is a gap between pact verification and actual deployment) then the following strategy is recommended. Each application version should be tagged in the broker with the name of the stage (eg. test, staging, production) as it is deployed (see the pact-broker create-version-tag CLI). This enables you to use the following very simple command to check if the application version you are about to deploy is compatible with every other application version already deployed in that environment.

  $ pact-broker can-i-deploy --pacticipant PACTICIPANT --version VERSION --to TAG --broker-base-url BROKER_BASE_URL

Check the status of the pacts for the latest pacticipant version:

  $ pact-broker can-i-deploy --pacticipant PACTICIPANT --latest --broker-base-url BROKER_BASE_URL

Check the status of the pacts for the latest pacticipant version for a given tag:

  $ pact-broker can-i-deploy --pacticipant PACTICIPANT --latest TAG --broker-base-url BROKER_BASE_URL

Check the status of the pacts between two (or more) specific pacticipant versions:

  $ pact-broker can-i-deploy --pacticipant PACTICIPANT1 --version VERSION1 --pacticipant PACTICIPANT2 --version VERSION2 --broker-base-url BROKER_BASE_URL

Check the status of the pacts between the latest versions of two (or more) pacticipants:

  $ pact-broker can-i-deploy --pacticipant PACTICIPANT1 --latest --pacticipant PACTICIPANT2 --latest --broker-base-url BROKER_BASE_URL

Check the status of the pacts between the latest versions of two (or more) pacticipants with a given tag:

$ pact-broker can-i-deploy --pacticipant PACTICIPANT1 --latest TAG1 --pacticipant PACTICIPANT2 --latest TAG2 --broker-base-url BROKER_BASE_URL
